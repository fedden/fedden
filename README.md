<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Leon</h1>

Nice to meet you! I'm a passionate Artificial Intelligence researcher, engineer and software developer, from the United Kingdom. I love writing code that processes signals in some way, be it image, sound, vibration or video, and I particularly enjoy writing learning systems that learn to solve some task without me having to explicitly code it myself! Previously I studied at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and I have founded a couple of startups that I have learned a lot from. I currently work at Hypersurfaces, where we are redeigning how the world can interact with everyday objects using Machine Learning 👨🏼‍💻.

In my free time, I love to work on a new startup that is going to revolutionise how we invest in property. Besides that, I love playing video games (last of us 2 was incredible), and being in the UK, I love cooking a big roast on Sunday. 🎉
