<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Leon</h1>

Nice to meet you! I'm a Deep Learning Lead at AstraZeneca, previously AI research at HyperSurfaces. I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence research, engineering and software development, from the United Kingdom. I love writing code that processes signals in some way, and I particularly enjoy writing learning systems that learn to solve some task without me having to explicitly code it myself! Previously I studied at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and I have founded a couple of startups that I have learned a lot from along the way.
